  <h2>Origin story</h2>
  <p>After years of research and implementation work in justice and health, one pattern kept repeating: people weren’t failing because they didn’t care—they were failing because the system didn’t fit how humans actually work. The answer wasn’t more forms; it was clearer decisions and kinder systems.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:12px">Why “Mangrove Method”?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rooted in care.</strong> Decisions anchored to values and real constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive by design.</strong> Brackish water is the norm; we build for change.</li>
    <li><strong>Protective structure.</strong> Tools and artifacts that make the work calmer, not heavier.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top:12px">Mangroves thrive where fresh meets salt—messy, shifting, alive. Their roots knit together to calm rough water and protect what’s growing. That’s the work.</p>

  <h2>The Mangrove Method</h2>
  <p class="sub">Practical research, humane systems, artifacts that travel.</p>

  <h3>Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smallest useful next step.</strong> Ship something true, then scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-grade outputs.</strong> Clean analysis → plain language → a call to action.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational empathy.</strong> Systems fit the humans who use them or they don’t count.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence with edges.</strong> We name limits, assumptions, and trade-offs explicitly.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts that endure.</strong> One-pagers, checklists, playbooks, dashboards—lightweight and reusable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top:18px">What this looks like in practice</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Right-sized measurement plans that avoid busywork.</li>
    <li>Logic models and SOPs matched to reality, not wishlists.</li>
    <li>Implementation check-ins with clear, finite tasks.</li>
    <li>Slide kits and briefs your team will actually share.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who’s behind the work</h2>
  <p><strong>Dr. Elizabeth Curley (PhD, MSW)</strong> works at the intersection of research, implementation, and design—helping people make good decisions sooner. Her background spans child & family welfare, justice, and program evaluation. She translates complex realities into clear plans and leaves teams with tools they’ll actually use.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What I’m good at:</strong> right-sized measurement, clean analysis, plain-language briefs, and humane systems.</li>
    <li><strong>How I work:</strong> start with the smallest useful step, keep it kind, and build only what serves the decision.</li>
  </ul>
