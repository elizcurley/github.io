  <h2>Origin story</h2>
  <p>Mangroves thrive where land and sea argue with each other, with roots that seem to connect everywhere. These roots tangle, filter, and hold, making shelter for life in choppy water. Mangrove Method grew from that same belief: that care is a structure, momentum is a practice, and the intertidal places of life deserve better support. I built this studio after years of applied research and community work because I kept seeing the same gap: good people with good intentions drowning in complicated language, paperwork, and habits that couldn’t quite bridge the space in between. My role is to turn intention into a workable plan and then guide you to the desired outcome.

  I am a social work researcher and creator who has spent years translating evidence into everyday practice — from education in the classroom to developing and piloting creative new programs for people who are incarcerated, to running high-level research projects with grant management. Beyond the degrees and titles, I’m also an award-winning poet, and I bring the art of innovation to everything that I do. Alongside that, I’ve been the friend people text when everything feels like “too much” — deadlines, forms, grief, logistics, and the thousand paper cuts of change. 
  <Br>
  Mangrove Method is where those worlds meet: practical help that still honors the human heart.
The name chose me. As a Florida native, I fell in love with mangroves — those living architectures that make new ground out of uncertainty. That’s the promise here: rooted care and methodical movement. We map what matters, decide what’s next, and build no-hassle systems that keep you moving when the tide turns

  <h3 style="margin-top:12px">Why “Mangrove Method”?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rooted in care.</strong> Decisions anchored to values and real constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive by design.</strong> Brackish water is the norm; we build for change.</li>
    <li><strong>Protective structure.</strong> Tools and artifacts that make the work calmer, not heavier.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top:12px">Mangroves thrive where fresh meets salt—messy, shifting, alive. Their roots knit together to calm rough water and protect what’s growing. That’s the work.</p>

  <h2>The Mangrove Method</h2>
  <p class="sub">Practical research, humane systems, artifacts that travel.</p>

  <h3>Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smallest useful next step.</strong> Ship something true, then scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-grade outputs.</strong> Clean analysis → plain language → a call to action.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational empathy.</strong> Systems fit the humans who use them or they don’t count.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence with edges.</strong> We name limits, assumptions, and trade-offs explicitly.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts that endure.</strong> One-pagers, checklists, playbooks, dashboards—lightweight and reusable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top:18px">What this looks like in practice</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Right-sized measurement plans that avoid busywork.</li>
    <li>Logic models and SOPs matched to reality, not wishlists.</li>
    <li>Implementation check-ins with clear, finite tasks.</li>
    <li>Slide kits and briefs your team will actually share.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who’s behind the work</h2>
  <p><strong>Dr. Elizabeth Curley (PhD, MSW)</strong> works at the intersection of research, implementation, and design—helping people make good decisions sooner. Her background spans child & family welfare, justice, and program evaluation. She translates complex realities into clear plans and leaves teams with tools they’ll actually use.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What I’m good at:</strong> right-sized measurement, clean analysis, plain-language briefs, and humane systems.</li>
    <li><strong>How I work:</strong> start with the smallest useful step, keep it kind, and build only what serves the decision.</li>
  </ul>
