  <h2>The moment</h2>
  <p>After years of research and implementation work in justice and health, one pattern kept repeating: people weren’t failing because they didn’t care—they were failing because the system didn’t fit how humans actually work. The answer wasn’t more forms; it was clearer decisions and kinder systems.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px">What the name holds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rooted in care.</strong> Decisions anchored to values and real constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive by design.</strong> Brackish water is the norm; we build for change.</li>
    <li><strong>Protective structure.</strong> Tools and artifacts that make the work calmer, not heavier.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:18px">From idea to practice</h2>
  <p>We start small, test gently, and keep only what helps. The goal isn’t to look impressive—it’s to move with clarity and leave you with artifacts you’ll still use in six months.</p>
