<div class="page-panel">
  <p><strong>Hi, I’m Dr. Elizabeth Curley (PhD, MSW).</strong> I work at the intersection of research, implementation, and design—helping people make good decisions sooner. My background is in child and family welfare, justice, and program evaluation. I translate complex realities into clear plans, and I leave teams with tools they’ll actually use.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>What I’m good at:</strong> right-sized measurement, clean analysis, plain-language briefs, and humane systems.</li>
    <li><strong>How I work:</strong> start with the smallest useful step, keep it kind, and build only what serves the decision.</li>
  </ul>
