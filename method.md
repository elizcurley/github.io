<div class="page-panel">
  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smallest useful next step.</strong> Ship something true, then scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-grade outputs.</strong> Clean analysis → plain language → a call to action.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational empathy.</strong> Systems fit the humans who use them or they don’t count.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence with edges.</strong> We name limits, assumptions, and trade-offs explicitly.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts that endure.</strong> One-pagers, checklists, playbooks, dashboards—lightweight and reusable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:20px">What this looks like in practice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Right-sized measurement plans that avoid busywork.</li>
    <li>Logic models and SOPs matched to reality, not wishlists.</li>
    <li>Implementation check-ins with clear, finite tasks.</li>
    <li>Slide kits and briefs your team will actually share.</li>
  </ul>
