  <div class="card cols-4">
    <h3>Referral pipeline, calmed</h3>
    <p class="sub">Prosecutor’s diversion option was under-referring and inconsistent across units.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> Narrow eligibility + confused handoffs at charging and first appearance.</li>
      <li><strong>What we did:</strong> Wrote clear referral rules, a 1-page checklist for line staff, and added a specialist touchpoint at court.</li>
      <li><strong>What changed:</strong> Faster, more consistent referrals without loosening safeguards.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifacts delivered:</strong> Program manual update, referral rule sheet, intake decision tree, 30-min staff mini-training deck.</li>
      <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> 3 weeks (2 short workshops + async edits).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card cols-4">
    <h3>Lean evaluation that guides decisions</h3>
    <p class="sub">Community org needed “just-enough” data to steer a pilot, not a thesis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> Multi-site program, scattered spreadsheets, no shared definitions.</li>
      <li><strong>What we did:</strong> Defined a right-sized measurement plan, built a tidy pipeline, and set a 1-page executive summary cadence.</li>
      <li><strong>What changed:</strong> Weekly decisions moved from vibes → visible trends and trade-offs.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifacts delivered:</strong> Data dictionary, import template, reproducible script, dashboard one-pager, decision log.</li>
      <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> 4–6 weeks (with a mid-point “pulse check”).</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="card cols-4">
    <h3>Sustainable flow for a solo creative</h3>
    <p class="sub">Client juggling a full-time job, a thesis-level project, and life admin.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> Good ideas, scattered follow-through, and burnout loops.</li>
      <li><strong>What we did:</strong> Mapped constraints, set a weekly “minimum viable” plan, and installed light routines with fail-safes.</li>
      <li><strong>What changed:</strong> Fewer spinning plates, more done items—without heroic weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifacts delivered:</strong> Weekly sprint board, two checklists, calendar holds, and a 4-line daily script.</li>
      <li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> 4 weeks + optional monthly stewardship.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What we typically leave behind</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One-pagers and decision memos people actually read</li>
    <li>Checklists, SOPs, and simple flows matched to reality</li>
    <li>Dashboards and briefs that travel well between teams</li>
    <li>Templates you own (and can adapt without us)</li>
  </ul>
